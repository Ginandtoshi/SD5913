# Inspiration
1. Stress relief >>> tons of output(offloading emotions and thoughts) >> ways of output (drawing, speaking out diary) >>> if words, what kind of representations? the more you say, the ink on the body disappears more? let the system to highlight emotional words?
2. Mechanism: start your diary > a black pixel person sitting on the ground >> as the text appears more, the person becomes whiter and whiter, the text you said reflect around the person >> after a certain amount of text, the person feels lighter and relived.

Inspired by the anime Mushishi season 1 episode 20, a sea of writings/A sea of ink where the protagonist needs to constantly write so that the ink worm possessed by her family through generations would disappear. When I am very stressed, I tend to write everything down, non-stop, basically just throw whatever comes to my mind out and clear up my mind. I find sometimes talking out helps to, but oftentime it is not written down, so you cannot see where the thoughts are coming from after you speak them out. This mini-program aims to use speech-to-text techniology to recreate this experience. I also make the user to be able to save the visual that they created with their input.
